## Architecture Decisions

### Why HTTP/3?
- Reduced latency through 0-RTT connections
- Better performance over unreliable networks
- Stream multiplexing without head-of-line blocking
- Native support for server push

### Why Go?
- Excellent concurrency primitives
- Low memory footprint
- Fast compilation and deployment
- Strong ecosystem for networking
- Good FFmpeg bindings

### Why Redis?
- Fast in-memory operations
- Pub/Sub for real-time updates
- Built-in expiration for sessions
- Clustering support for scaling
- Proven reliability

### Why SRT Primary Protocol?
- Built for live video streaming
- Packet loss recovery
- Low latency with reliability
- Encryption built-in
- Better than raw RTP for internet delivery

### Video Pipeline Design (Phase 2)
- Packet → Frame → GOP abstraction
- Video-aware buffering prevents corruption
- GOP boundaries for clean switching
- Memory pools for efficiency
- Backpressure at every stage

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- `internal/`: Private packages not for external use
- `pkg/`: Public packages that could be imported
- `cmd/`: Executable entry points
- Keep packages focused and cohesive

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for external dependencies
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Minimum 80% code coverage target

### Error Handling
- Use custom error types for better context
- Wrap errors with additional information
- Map errors to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Log errors with trace IDs for debugging

### Performance Considerations
- Profile before optimizing
- Use buffer pools for memory efficiency
- Implement proper backpressure
- Monitor goroutine counts
- Set appropriate timeouts

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Docker Compose for local environment
- Hot reload for rapid iteration
- Local Redis and MinIO instances
- Self-signed certificates

### Staging
- Kubernetes deployment
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Shared Redis cluster
- S3-compatible storage

### Production
- Multi-region deployment
- GPU-enabled instances
- CloudFront CDN
- Auto-scaling groups
- Blue-green deployments
